# Cephalon-Alice
A Warframe codex tracker. Period.

Since DE has no public-facing user API, and the official app is plagued with terrible performance and UI issues, when it comes time to peruse labs for new mastery experience, I constantly have to jump back and forth between my codex and a variety of screens (and places). Which is bad.

So I built a small cephalon in my basement that can help me track my collection and what I have and have not yet mastered. She is accessible through anything that can view a webpage at https://cephalon-4092a.firebaseapp.com, so by all means have a look-see. I quite enjoy small hobby projects like this, so there will likely be some future improvements and functionality as more ideas and inconveniences come to mine, so if that interests you, feel free to watch this repo for changes. For now though, a few tips on using the system.

Once logged into the system, you are brought to a simple search menu where you can quickly input entries to tag as mastered in your personal codex. This will be the main panel you will be using after manually copying over your codex from in-game; open the site on your phone, fill in the search input (fancy autocomplete!), and hit submit. Presto changeo, updated.

The second panel is the full codex, a categorized replica of the in-game version. Once you register, your first step will be to pull up your in-game codex and go category by category checking off what you've already achieved. This should be a relatively painless task, if a bit dull, but once you're set up all it takes is a quick update whenever you master a new piece of gear.

There are a couple keyboard shortcuts built to help navigate, with more available if any ideas pops up. You can view the shortcuts at any time by pressing the '?' key.

If you have any questions or concerns, or ideas or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue here on the repository and I'll get back to you when I can. Cheers, and hope you find this tool useful.
